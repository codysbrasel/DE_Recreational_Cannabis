Understand the German Recreational Cannabis Market - the results and presentation of my Data Analytics final project at Spiced.
## Purpose
This report dives into the German market and what their thoughts are on recreational cannabis. It analyzes survey responses from 1,083 respondents and asks about support or opposition for legalization, level of agreeance to different aspects of a recreational market, benefits and disadvantages to legalization, and level of agreeance to possible features of a legal market.
### I set out to answer the following questions:
1. What is the demographic most likely to try legal cannabis?
2. How does Germany feel about recreational cannabis?
3. What features does Germany want to see in a legal recreational market? 
### This is what I found:
The demographics most likely to try legal cannabis is Gen Z or Millennials; likely male; from the SE quadrant of Germany; remote or rural areas followed closely by metropolitan areas; studying or employed; with an occupations as a student, semi-skilled or unskilled manual worker, or high managerial administrative professional.

Germans overall support legalization with bundeslands ranging from 47-82% in favor of legalization; however, they are skeptical about the risks with bundesland responses between 25-49% saying they would try legal cannabis. The biggest benefits of legalization include removing cannabis from the black market and away from criminal gangs, reduced use of more harmful illegal drugs, and economic reasons such as tax revenue generation and refocusing police on more important matters. The greatest risks of legalizing it is the concern of increased use specifically that it may lead to an increase in people driving while using cannabis, more people will use it, and an increase in youth use.

Finally, the top features that Germany wants to see in a legal recreational market, those features with greater than 50% in support are:  sales to 18+ only, using tax revenue to fund cannabis education and drug treatment, advertising ban, plain packaging with health warnings, restrictions on smoking or consuming in outdoor public places, limits on potency of products, and the sale of cannabis products through government regulated stores.
